Parallel and Throughput-Optimized Programming by Prof. Sifakis

## Key takeaways

- With sparse matrices, it is important to identify patterns for transformations to result in reordering and parallelism performance at a divided level (i.e. a chunk of a larger full matrix or the factor in cholesky). **Think about using ML to apply the right set of transformations to achieve the right performance on sparsity** *engineering*.
